We introduced a few changes to make all of the core GitHub features free for everyone. Private repositories with unlimited collaborators are now available for all GitHub accounts, and weâ€™re reducing prices for some of our paid plans.

The details
We introduced a new GitHub Free plan for teams with unlimited collaborators in private repositories, 2,000 GitHub Actions minutes/month, and GitHub Community Support.
You now have unlimited collaborators in private repositories as part of your GitHub Free plan.
Monthly pricing for our Pro plan has been reduced from $7/month to $4/month.
Monthly pricing for our paid Team plan has been reduced from $9/user to $4/user.
Actions minutes and Packages storage will continue to be free for all public repositories.
